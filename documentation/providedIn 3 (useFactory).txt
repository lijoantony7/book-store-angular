useFactory in providedIn
-------------------------
Scenario: we need to apply a logic before creating the instance of the service.

useFactory is a way to tell Angular how to create a service
or value using a function. This function is called a factory function,
and it can contain logic to create the service or value based on certain conditions or dependencies.

Why Use useFactory?
Dynamic Configuration: When you need to create a service or value dynamically at runtime.
Complex Initialization: When the initialization logic is complex and cannot be done with a simple value.

provide: CounterService, useFactory: (testService: TestService)=>
      testService.status ? new CounterService() : new Counter2Service(),
      deps: [TestService]

in useFactory we are giving an conditions to use the instance. The conditions are in testServce.
 -> deps in this is dependencies of this useFactory.
 -> we can put the favtory code in separate file to redability and reusability.
