MODULE APP
ng new my-app --standalone false

Declarations
Components, directives, and pipes must be declared in exactly one module.
The declarations array is used for this purpose. This tells Angular that these components,
 directives, and pipes belong to this specific module.

Exports
The exports array is used to make components, directives, and pipes available to other
modules that import this module. If a component, directive, or pipe is not exported,
it will not be accessible outside its own module.

imports
This array lists other Angular modules that are required by this module.
CommonModule is imported to use common Angular directives like ngIf and ngFor.
