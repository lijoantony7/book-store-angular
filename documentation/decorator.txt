This is called decorator: the @Component is a decorator in Angular. Decorators are a special kind of 
                declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. 
                They are used to provide metadata that Angular uses to understand how to process a class.

templateUrl OR template can be used a time.
styleUrl OR styles can ve used a time.
This will simplify the files (component.html or component.css) can be deleted.
