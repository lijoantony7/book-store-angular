useValue in providedIn
-------------------------

useValue provider allows you to define a simple value
that can be injected into your components, services,
or other parts of your application. This is useful
when you need to provide constant values or configuration
settings throughout your application.

providers: [
  AuthService,
  { provide: LoginService, useExisting: AuthService }
],

 providers: [{provide: Counter2Service <token>, useExisting: CounterService <provider>},
             CounterService,
             {provide: 'appTitle', useValue: 'This is title of app'}
            ],

in useValue, we can pass any type of data: array, objects...

And, useValue value can be used in everywhere of the app.
for that, ex, using in component.ts
      In constructor use @Inject('provideName') public varname: varType
