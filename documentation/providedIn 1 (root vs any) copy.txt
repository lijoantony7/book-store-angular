PROVIDEDIN: ROOT VS ANY
-----------------------

[[[[The PROVIDERS array in Angular's AppModule (or any other module)
is a crucial part of the dependency injection system.
It allows you to register services and other dependencies.]]]]

the providedIn metadata for services in the @Injectable decorator
indicates where the service should be provided.

providedIn: 'root'
------------------
the service is registered in the root injector of the application.
ie, SINGLETON INSTANCE A single instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application.
eg: logging service, or a configuration service.

providedIn: 'any'
-----------------
the service is provided in all injectors.
ie, MULTIPLE INSTANCE: A new instance of the service is created for each lazy-loaded module that imports it.
Each instance is unique to the module.
eg: A FeatureService that should have a separate instance for each feature module.

(In both) Tree Shakable: If the service is not used anywhere in the application,
                        it will be removed during the build process (tree-shaking).
