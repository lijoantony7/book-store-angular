constructor(private routes: ActivatedRoute, private router: Router) { }
bookDetail(userId:number, authorId:number): void{
    this.router.navigate(['/public/book-details', userId, 'author', authorId],
      {queryParams: {name: 'Lijo'}}
    );
  }

In the component, thought the btn click we can navigate to another url. 
-> Add one more para in the constructor (Router is also a service that's why its in constructor)
-> this.router.navigate() inside this we can give the url same as we give in html page.
	we can also pass the query in the url.
-> in html: <button (click)="bookDetail(10, 120)">Book Detail</button>
