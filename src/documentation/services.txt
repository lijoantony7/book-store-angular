ANGULAR SERVICE Create
----------------------
service is a special TypeScript class that contains methods and fields1.
Itâ€™s a piece of reusable code with a focused purpose.

Purpose: Services are used to provide functionality that can be used by multiple components, like retrieving data from an API or handling user authentication.

Usage: Services can be used for features that are independent of components such as logging services, sharing logic or data across components, and encapsulating external interactions like data access.

-> job of components is to show the data, but data comes from service.
  All service in ANGULAR is works in Dipendancy Injection (DI).
  By injectable concept is service. By using @Injectable we are making it as Service.

  Creation: ng g s <servicename>

  Now its for bookService so, books/service/book-service

  @Injectable({
    "providerIn":"root"
  })
  export class BookService{

  }

SERVICE DATA MODEL
------------------
Create a folder for model: clss with properties
  books/model/book-model

HOW TO USE SERVICE
------------------
To use the service in our components,
  Using DI, Inject this service in constrctor of the components:
  1. constrctor(servicevar: serviceName){}
  2. in OnInit(){
    call the methods from service.
  }

SERVICE ACCESS
--------------
In components, to use the service,
We can add this in component level(In component decorator) or Module level (in module decorator).
  @Component({
    providers: [serviceName]
})

IF THE SERVICE IN ACCESS FOR ALL THE APP LEVEL
----------------------------------------------
In the service itseft we can give: providerIn:root
@Injectable({
    "providerIn":"root"
  })
