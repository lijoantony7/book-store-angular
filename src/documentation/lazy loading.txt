Lazy loading is a design pattern.
  Used to optimize the performance of app by loading comp, modules, or assests as
  they required.

IMPROVED INITIAL LOAD TIME: By only loading required components initially,
  app's initial load time is reduced.
REDUCED MEMORY FOOTRINT: loading required components reduce memory footprint.
  (we can check this in network tab of console)
BETTER CODE ORGANIZATION.

How Does Lazy Loading Work in Angular?
  Angular creates a Single Page Application
  (SPA), where all of its components are loaded at once. This could mean that
  a lot of unnecessary libraries or modules might be loaded as well, which can
  increase the load time as the application grows

CODE
----
{path: 'user/:userId', component: UserComponent,
    loadChildren: () => import('./user/user.module').then(x => x.UserModule)
},

loadChildren will load the required components only when its required.
